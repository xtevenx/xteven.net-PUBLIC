Being early in the season, I was slightly worried about the weather, but when some friends decided to do a bike-accessible backpacking overnighter along the way, I started packing.<h2>May 2, 2025</h2><p>I finished packing in the morning and left at a not-so-early 9:00 towards the nearest SkyTrain station. The riding proper started at Lafarge Lake, following parts of the Trans Canada Trail along with some nice separated greenway along Kingsway Avenue. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures from this section because I was busy trying to diagnose a minor speed wobble that wouldn't go away...<p>Crossing the river into Pitt Meadows, the forest of office buildings and low rise apartments was replaced with a field of farmsteads and the occasional earthy scent of freshly plowed fields. The roads were pan-flat, the air was calm, and the still-snow-capped Coquitlam Range mountains provided a constant views throughout. It would have been a perfect ride, if not for the constant stream of cars rushing past with no regard for the 1.5m minimum passing distance enacted less than a year ago. Alas, complaining wouldn't accomplish anything there, so I continued on and the cars became a bit less frequent after entering Golden Ears Provincial Park.<p><img alt="white house in front of mountains" src=DSC_0388.jpg> A pretty white farmhouse.<p>Writing in progress.
