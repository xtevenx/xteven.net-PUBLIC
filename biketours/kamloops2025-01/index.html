Being early in the season, I was slightly worried about the weather, but when some friends decided to do a bike-accessible backpacking overnighter along the way, I started packing.<h2>May 2, 2025</h2><p>I finished packing in the morning and left at a not-so-early 9:00 towards the nearest SkyTrain station. After just under an hour on transit, the riding proper started at Lafarge Lake, following parts of the Trans Canada Trail along with some nice separated greenway along Kingsway Avenue.<p>Crossing the river into Pitt Meadows, the maze of office buildings and low rise apartments was replaced with fields, farmsteads and the occasional earthy scent of fertilizer. The roads were flat, the air was calm, and the still-snow-capped Coquitlam Range mountains provided a pleasant backdrop to the scenery. And the riding would have been perfect, if not for the constant stream of cars rushing past with no regard for the 1.5m minimum passing rule that must have been enacted no more than a year ago. Alas, complaining wouldn't accomplish anything, so I continued on and the cars became a bit less frequent after entering Golden Ears Provincial Park.<p><img alt src=DSC_0388.avif> A pretty white farmhouse.<p>The rest of the day was as uneventful as it gets. Just after noon, I joined my friends at the Gold Creek Parking Lot, and was caught up with the plan. Turns out we were to hang out for a couple hours while waiting for a late arriver, which was fine with me as I got time to catch up on the sleep that I didn't get the night before. It was almost 18:00 when we finally arrived at the Viewpoint Beach camping area, and with grey clouds rolling in for the forecasted overnight showers, I quickly pitched my tent, ate dinner, and settled into my sleeping pad, listening to the first patters of rain fall on our sea of tents.<h2>May 3, 2025</h2><p>Writing in progress.<div id=footer>© 2025; Steven Xia</div>
