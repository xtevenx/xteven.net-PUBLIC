Being early in the season, I was slightly worried about the weather, but when some friends decided to do a bike-accessible backpacking overnighter along the way, I started packing.<h2>May 2, 2025</h2><p>I finished packing in the morning and left at a not-so-early 9:00 towards the nearest SkyTrain station. After just under an hour on transit, the riding proper started at Lafarge Lake, following parts of the Trans Canada Trail along with some nice separated greenway along Kingsway Avenue.<p>Crossing the river into Pitt Meadows, the maze of office buildings and low rise apartments was replaced with fields, farmsteads, and the occasional earthy scent of fertilizer. The roads were flat, the air was calm, and the still-snow-capped Coquitlam Range mountains provided a pleasant backdrop to the scenery. And the riding would have been perfect, if not for the constant stream of cars rushing past with no regard for the 1.5m minimum passing rule that must have been enacted no more than a year ago. Alas, complaining wouldn't accomplish anything, so I continued on and the cars became a bit less frequent after entering Golden Ears Provincial Park.<p><img alt loading=lazy src=DSC_0388.avif> A pretty white farmhouse.<p>The rest of the day was as uneventful as it gets. Just after noon, I joined my friends at the Gold Creek Parking Lot, and was caught up with the plan. Turns out we were to hang out for a couple hours while waiting for a late arriver, which was fine with me as I got time to catch up on the sleep that I didn't get the night before. It was almost 18:00 when we finally arrived at the Viewpoint Beach camping area, and with grey clouds rolling in for the forecasted overnight showers, I quickly pitched my tent, ate dinner, and settled into my sleeping pad, listening to the first patters of rain fall on our sea of tents.<h2>May 3, 2025</h2><p>Though not early, the morning was dark and dreary when I awoke. Quietly, I retrieved my food from the bear cache and ate my favourite breakfast of tortillas and honey. It was already 10:00 when I bid farewell to the group and set off alone, slowly retracing the rocky trail I rode in on the day before. Progress was slow, as there were numerous sections which were too rough to ride on the loaded touring bike, but in my anticipation for the week ahead of me, I didn't mind it at all. I was informed by some passing hikers that the trail is usually much nicer, but a winter of rain must have washed a lot away. Before I knew it though, the ground transitioned from trail, to pavement, and eventually I joined the rushing traffic of Highway 7.<p>The first time highway riding in a long time always triggers an adrenaline rush, but I just turned on my blinky red light and told myself to get used to it. No point in worrying about something you're stuck with, right? And I was going to be stuck with it for the rest of day. And the day after. And the day after that.<p>About 70km into the ride, I came across a road closure caused by an accident. A <a href=https://www.randonneurs.bc.ca/newsletter/submissions_2025/014_weakened-warriors-2025_bob-goodison.html>group of friendly randonneurs</a> I met earlier in the day was also stalled there, and I was lucky for that because they led me on a fun mixed surface bypass to avoid waiting for the road to clear.<p><img alt loading=lazy src=DSC_0403.avif> There were some nice views on the detour.<p>The sun was nearing the horizon by the time I neared Hope, turning the towering mountains a sublime shade of deep blue. Delayed by the road closure, I decided to book a motel for the night to start this trip on a good note and avoid pitching my tent in the dark.<p><img alt loading=lazy src=DSC_0416.avif> Silver Peak (left) and Isolillock Peak (right).<h2>May 4, 2025</h2><p>Breakfast was had at <a href=https://www.cafehopemountain.com/>Hope Mountain Cafe</a>, consisting of mediocre (to my taste) coffee but excellent poutine. Following this, I left the motel at around 9:30 and started the long ascent up to Allison Pass that would take most of the day. So up, up, and up, I went, with only the changing weather to indicate progress—ranging from 8 degrees and hailing to 25 and sunny—as I slowly climbed my way to 1342m.<p>Along the way, I passed a viewpoint for the aftermath of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Slide>Hope Slide</a>, a 1965 landslide which was at the time the largest in Canadian history. There was an information board which provided some description of the site, as well as relatively well maintained pit toilets.<p><img alt loading=lazy src=DSC_0427.avif> The aftermath of the Hope Slide.<p>As I went over the top, two extremes of bike touring showed themselves: I was cheered on by multiple cars as I neared the summit of the pass, and was subsequently ran off the road by a trucker as I started the descent. Try as I might otherwise, I must speculate that the latter was an intentional act, as there was an uncommonly wide shoulder on that stretch of road, and they had run substantially over the rumble strips to get to me.<p>The rest of the day was almost all descent, and barring a short stop at a gas station to buy some snacks (and seemingly annoy the cashier, as they merely gave a strange glare when I thanked them), went without a hitch. I got to Copper Creek Recreation Site at an early 17:00, and with only one other party there, settled at the second best campsite.<div id=footer>© 2025; Steven Xia</div>
